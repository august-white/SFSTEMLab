# Prisma Seeding and Querying Guide

Prisma provides a flexible way to seed your database with initial data and offers various methods for querying that data. This guide will help you understand the differences between regular seeding, seeding with join tables, and the different querying methods available.

## 1. Regular Seeding
Regular seeding involves inserting data into a model without any complex relationships or joins.

### Example: Seeding Data in a Simple Model
```js
// Seeding a simple model, e.g., User
const usersData = [
  {
    email: 'user1@example.com',
    password: 'password123',
    username: 'user1',
  },
  {
    email: 'user2@example.com',
    password: 'password456',
    username: 'user2',
  },
];

await prisma.user.createMany({
  data: usersData,
  skipDuplicates: true, // Ensures no duplicate entries are created
});
```

### Explanation
- createMany(): This method is used to insert multiple records in one go.
- skipDuplicates: true: This option prevents duplicate records from being inserted.

## 2. Seeding with Join Tables
When your models involve many-to-many relationships or join tables, seeding becomes slightly more complex. You need to ensure that you first seed the data for each model and then seed the join tables.

### Example: Seeding a Many-to-Many Relation
In this case, let's seed users and roles, and then link them through the join table (for example, `UserRole`).

```js
// Seeding Roles
const rolesData = [
  { name: 'Admin' },
  { name: 'User' },
];

await prisma.role.createMany({
  data: rolesData,
  skipDuplicates: true,
});

// Seeding Users
const usersData = [
  {
    email: 'user1@example.com',
    password: 'password123',
    username: 'user1',
  },
  {
    email: 'user2@example.com',
    password: 'password456',
    username: 'user2',
  },
];

await prisma.user.createMany({
  data: usersData,
  skipDuplicates: true,
});

// Seeding UserRoles (Join Table)
const users = await prisma.user.findMany(); // Get all users
const roles = await prisma.role.findMany(); // Get all roles

const userRolesData = [
  {
    userId: users[0].id, // User 1
    roleId: roles[0].id, // Admin
  },
  {
    userId: users[1].id, // User 2
    roleId: roles[1].id, // User
  },
];

await prisma.userRole.createMany({
  data: userRolesData,
  skipDuplicates: true,
});
```

### Explanation
Find Users and Roles: First, we seed both users and roles, then query for their IDs.
Seed the Join Table: Use `userId` and `roleId` to seed the join table `UserRole`.

## 3. Querying in Prisma
Prisma provides several ways to query your database. Hereâ€™s how you can use them:

**`findUnique()`**
This method is used to retrieve a single record based on a unique field (like id or email).
```js
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    email: 'user1@example.com',
  },
});
console.log(user);
```

### Explanation
- `findUnique()`: Retrieves a single record based on a unique field, such as `email` or `id`.

**`findMany()`**
Use this method to retrieve multiple records, potentially filtered by certain conditions.
```javascript
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: { contains: 'example.com' }, // Users with 'example.com' in their email
  },
});
console.log(users);
```

### Explanation
**`findMany()`**: Retrieves multiple records based on filtering criteria, such as contains, equals, etc.

**`findFirst()`**
Similar to findUnique(), but not restricted to unique fields. It finds the first record that matches the filter criteria.

```js
const firstUser = await prisma.user.findFirst({
  where: {
    email: { contains: 'example.com' },
  },
});
console.log(firstUser);
```

Explanation
findFirst(): Retrieves the first matching record based on the filter criteria, even if the field is not unique.
include and select for Relations
You can also retrieve related data (like a user's posts or roles) using the include or select options.

typescript
Copy code
const userWithPosts = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: {
    posts: true, // Include all related posts
  },
});
console.log(userWithPosts);
Or using select:

typescript
Copy code
const userWithSelect = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: 1 },
  select: {
    email: true, // Only select the email field
    username: true, // Only select the username field
  },
});
console.log(userWithSelect);
Explanation
include: Used to include related models when querying (e.g., getting all posts for a user).
select: Used to select specific fields from the model.
4. Advanced Filtering and Pagination
Prisma allows you to perform advanced queries with filters and pagination.

Filtering by Conditions
typescript
Copy code
const filteredUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { email: { contains: 'example.com' } },
      { username: { contains: 'user' } },
    ],
  },
});
Pagination
typescript
Copy code
const paginatedUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  skip: 0, // Offset for pagination
  take: 10, // Limit the number of results
});
Explanation
Filtering: You can use logical operators like AND, OR, NOT to perform complex filtering.
Pagination: Use skip and take to paginate through records efficiently.
5. create, update, delete
You can use Prisma to create, update, or delete records.

Create a Record
typescript
Copy code
const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'newuser@example.com',
    password: 'password789',
    username: 'newuser',
  },
});
console.log(newUser);
Update a Record
typescript
Copy code
const updatedUser = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'user1@example.com' },
  data: { username: 'updatedUser1' },
});
console.log(updatedUser);
Delete a Record
typescript
Copy code
const deletedUser = await prisma.user.delete({
  where: { email: 'user2@example.com' },
});
console.log(deletedUser);
Explanation
create(): Inserts a new record into the database.
update(): Updates a specific record based on a unique field.
delete(): Deletes a specific record based on a unique field.
Conclusion
Seeding: Regular seeding is for basic models, and seeding with join tables requires special handling for relationships.
Queries: Prisma offers several querying methods, like findUnique(), findMany(), and findFirst(), which allow you to retrieve data in various ways.
Filtering and Pagination: Prisma's powerful filtering system allows for complex queries, and pagination makes handling large datasets easier.
Create, Update, Delete: These methods let you manage your data easily.
